# sieze-the-castle-text-adventure
A text adventure + deck builder rougelikish game. In Python 3.16.

This project was for fun, both in the making and in the playing. 

This program imports random, copy, and colorist.

There are no major future plans for this game. I may go back and tweak the balance, maybe add a few more levels and cards, but right now it stands on its own.
